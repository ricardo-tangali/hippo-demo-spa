# About React SPA Demo

The React SPA demo located at [react](react) was created in the same way
how it is explained in [Getting Started with React](https://www.onehippo.org/library/concepts/spa-plus/how-tos/getting-started-with-react.html).

Additionally, this React SPA demo was improved in the following:

- More specific React class examples for reusability. e.g. Page, Container, Container Item, Component Wrapper, etc. in [react/src/cms-components/core/](react/src/cms-components/core).
- More specific React class examples for reusable Essentials components. e.g, Banner, Content, News Item, News List, etc. in [react/src/cms-components/essentials/](react/src/cms-components/essentials).
- Extra React code with [Channel Manager SPA API](https://www.onehippo.org/library/concepts/spa-plus/channel-manager-spa-api/introduction.html) for a seamless integration with the Channel Manager.
